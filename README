Data that will be used: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

# 1.) Always a good rule of thumb to download two versions. One in RStudio (URL) and another onto your local files

# 2.) Before beginning to clean the data be sure to install the following packages to makwe the process easy 
install.packages("data.table")
  library(data.table")
install.packages("jsonlite")
  library(jsonlite)
 ## Kept running into an issue with separating the variables into columns so after research in Stack Overflow and GitHub use the following package 12-7-2022
install.packghes("reshape2")
  library(reshape2)

# 3.) Next is to download the following that will be used for its data. I later changed the name to "smartphone" cause its the study that I am understanding of this project 
## However be sure to unzip the files cause I ran into an issue with not unzipping the files causing issues that would have been simple from the beginning
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(url, file.path(path, "dataFiles.zip"))
unzip(zipfile = "dataFiles.zip")
smartphone <- unzip 

# 4.) Load the activity labels & features 
activityLabels <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
